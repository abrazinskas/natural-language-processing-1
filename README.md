# Natural language processing I materials

## Course description
This course aims at providing the student with the background that is needed for studying statistical models that are used in the field of Computational Linguistics.
We will mostly depart from shallow labeling tasks and consider tasks that involve hierarchical structure (e.g., syntactic trees) and/or hidden structure (alignment of word and their translations in machine translation).
For these tasks the course will concentrate on the fundamentals of probabilistic modeling and statistical learning from data by supervised and unsupervised statistical learning algorithms.
